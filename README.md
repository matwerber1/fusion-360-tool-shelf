# Fusion 360 Tool Shelf

This project contains a Fusion 360 project file to create a simple shelf that has drawers on the bottom and a flat shelf on top. 

The project assumes you will be building with 1/2" plywood. However, you can adjust the plywood thickness, as well as all other key dimensions (depth, height, width, number of slots) and the project will auto-update. 

This project was inspired by seeing lots of similar shelves available on Etsy, [such as this one](https://www.etsy.com/listing/917846047/cnc-made-cordless-drill-organizer-wall?ref=landingpage_similar_listing_top-4&pro=1&frs=1). These existing options look well-made, but given that I have a woodshop, I wanted to build my own. 

## Examples

You can easily adjust the size and number of slots on the lower shelf by changing the project parameters:

For example, the screenshot below shows what it looks like to add an extra slot, increase the plywood thickness to 3/4", and make our top shelf a bit shorter:

And this is what the modified parameters look like for the shelf above:
